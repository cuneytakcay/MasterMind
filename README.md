Mathematics Mastermind is a desktop game built with C#. Game is similar to Mastermind board game except numbers are used in this version. Computer generates a 4-digit-number and the player tries to guess it. 

## How to play
1. Press "Start" button, and the computer will generate a non-repeating 4-digit-number.
2. Enter your guess and press the blue button.

***Example:*** 
    Original number = 3710
    Player's guess = 3192
    Result = +1 -1
    
*Here + 1 tells that the player got one digit in its original place, and -1 tells that another digit is guessed correctly, except it is not on its original place.*
